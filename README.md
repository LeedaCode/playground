# PIXI Playground

The playground application is a server and client that allow you to create, view, save,
and share small Pixi demos.

- Client code is in the [client folder][cf].
- Server code is in the [server folder][sf].

## Usage:

To run the application locally open two terminals, one to the [client folder][cf] and one to the [server folder][sf].

In each of them run `npm install` to install their individual dependencies. Then run `npm run dev` for each to start
locally. Finally, visit http://localhost:8080. Details can be found in the respective READMEs.
